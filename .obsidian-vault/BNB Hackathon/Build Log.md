# Build Log

Chronological record of what's been built and the decisions behind it. The authoritative
*why* lives in the linked topic notes; this is the timeline. See [[Index]] for navigation
and [[Project Overview]] for scope.

## 2026-06-05 — Foundation (Phase 1)

- CLAUDE.md, agent roster, `/orient`, repo/git init, Python `src/trader/` skeleton, `trader`
  MCP server stub.
- Vault: the 8 empty topic stubs developed into full notes.

## 2026-06-06 — Data layer + token universe

### Strategy theory (design discussions → [[Trading Strategies]])

Worked out the *edge* before the plumbing:

- **"Bitcoin is King" factor model** — `r_alt = α + β·r_btc + ε`; the residual ε is the
  idiosyncratic signal; two-factor BTC+BNB; time-varying/downside β; lead-lag.
- **Microstructure edges** — front-runners (alt leads BTC), stop-hunts (liquidity grabs),
  played as **resting orders at pre-computed prices** to beat on-chain latency.
- **Reflexivity / second-order** — indicators map where the crowd's orders sit; trade the
  reaction, not the indicator.
- **Adversarial-market thesis** — BSC tokens are dev-controlled, negative-sum; the edge is
  **risk discrimination**, not fearlessness.
- **Sequencing decision** — *training-first*: build the simulated-market / strategy core
  before the live execution layer. The June-16 internal milestone is reframed to "a working
  trained agent"; the live on-chain loop (TWAK signing, on-chain registration) is a separate
  later spike that still must land before **June 22**.

### Data layer (built, tested, committed)

- **Data sourcing validated and re-routed** (mostly keyless): **GeckoTerminal** (OHLCV) +
  **DexScreener** (screen) + **CMC** (contract resolution) + **GoPlus** (forensics).
  BscScan dropped — Etherscan unified to a V2 key whose **free tier is Ethereum-only; BSC is
  paid** ([[Tech Stack]]).
- `trader.data.downloader` — resumable, cached **Parquet** OHLCV backfill (per-page manifest
  checkpoint, exponential 429 backoff). Proven live + offline (crash-resume, 429 tests).
- `trader.data.cmc` — CMC contract resolver; **corrected 22 wrong pools** vs symbol-search
  (147/148 resolved, fixing 35% ambiguity).
- `trader.data.goplus` — forensic rug/honeypot gate; **removed BAS (hidden owner) + FORM
  (blacklist)**; resumable cache for GoPlus's flaky keyless tier.
- `trader.data.select` — turnover-ranked, CMC-rank-tiered selection with `--exclude`/`--pin`
  manual overrides.
- **Locked the 20-token universe** → [[Token Universe]].
- **OHLCV backfill** (daily + hourly) — **complete for all 20** (~181d daily, ~200d hourly,
  cached to Parquet). 1-minute subset for the liquid names is next.
- **46 tests passing.**

### TradeSim handoff analysis (`tradesim_handoff_seed/`)

Analyzed the prior project's lean handoff; verdict captured in [[Simulated Market]] /
[[AI Training]]:
- **Most valuable artifact = the lessons** — esp. *entry timing never beat random; exits /
  risk-management carried performance* — logged as a research question against our
  entry-centric edge thesis.
- **Ports clean:** leakage guard, metrics suite, benchmarks/backtester, indicator registry
  (+71-col feature schema), grouped-attention extractor.
- **Adapt:** broker (AMM slippage), dataset (→ multi-asset), reward (→ ruin-aware).
- **Data caveat:** the seed's BTC slice is Sep 2024–Apr 2025 only and does **not** overlap our
  alt window → still need a fresh ccxt BTC+BNB pull for the factor model.
- **Discipline to adopt:** real (tested) regime curriculum, fee-blind reward, benchmark gate
  before versioning, smoke test before full runs.

### In flight / next

- **1-minute** subset for the liquid names (front-run / sweep features).
- **BTC + BNB anchor series** (ccxt) for the factor model.
- Feature engineering → residual/factor model → [[Simulated Market]] broker → backtest.

## Phase status (vs [[Project Overview]] build path)

- ✅ **Phase 1** — Foundation.
- 🔄 **Phase 3/4** — Decision logic + offline validation: data layer + universe done; honest
  broker, features, and backtest are the active work.
- ⬜ **Phase 2** — Stack spike / live on-chain loop: **deferred** under the training-first
  plan; a focused execution+custody spike (TWAK dust trade, registration dry-run) is still
  required before June 22.
- ⬜ **June 16 PoC gate** — reframed internally to "trained agent"; the live-loop gate itself
  is not yet met (no on-chain trade landed).
